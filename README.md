# Welcome!!!
Welcome to Object Oriented Adventures, made by 
## Protagonist
YOU have been chosen to be the star of the game! Yes, YOU! You are an adventurer lost in the world's biggest and most twisted "maze" and is trying to escape.
## Monsters
Some of these are made up, others stolen. You typically encounter them at random. They can appear wherever you go. Yes, really! There's bosses too, but they're more difficult to beat and need extra stuff like weapons, charms, and food.
## NPCs
Some of these characters carry a sidequest with them, others are just there for funny jokes or decorative purposes. 
What they ask you to do is related to some other NPCs, items, monsters, whatever comes to mind! 
#### Example:
```python
"FINISH MY RUSSIAN HOMEWORK, PEASANT."
                            - Staten Island Tech-er
    Accept Quest            You good?
```

### merchants
Buy your goods and weapons here! They'll be scattered around checkpoints in case you die or whatever.
### guides
Most of this game is just inputs, so there's not a lot of complex things to do. When you fight, it's going to be slightly more difficult to comprehend. 
## items
```python
def spend_money(input()):
    # igrni
def sell(item, user):
    qjiqji = user.money - item.cost
def trade(item, item):
    #wwwww
```
